<h1>Roux Academy of Art and Design </h1>
<h1>Academic Programs</h1>
<p>At Roux, students work in specially designed studios, within a community of practicing artists and designers, where discussions between students in different years and in different subjects are promoted and encouraged. They have access to well-equipped workshops across the school and are supported by technicians and instructors highly skilled in their craft and its processes. Students practice inquiry-based learning, informed by well-developed theoretical and historical positions. We expect our students to display self-motivation and autonomy, which form the basis for originality and risk taking. We promote the absence of boundaries, as the basis for real innovation.</p>
<h2>Academic Departments</h2>
<p>Roux is comprised of eleven departments, from 3D Graphic Design to Video and Filmmaking. A sample of our departments and their unique focuses are summarized below. Please contact the department chair(s) for more information.</p>
<h3>Animation</h3>
<p>Department chair: <strong>Gerard Montague</strong><br>
The Animation department gives students a chance to blend the old with the new, to create unique and entertaining animated stories. From the decades old art of flipbooks, to stop motion animation and animatronics, to digital animation â€“ students in the Animation department are provided the depth and breadth needed to succeed in today&rsquo;s wildly competitive field of animation.</p>
<h3>Fashion and Textile Design</h3>
<p>Department chair: <strong>Lulu DeChamp</strong><br>
In the Fashion + Textile Design, designers focus initially basic construction techniques and trends and technologies in the fashion industry. The last half of instruction covers the completion of a complete ready-to-wear line.</p>
<h3>Fine Art and Visual Culture</h3>
<p>Department chair: <strong>Eliza Brethon</strong><br>
The Fine Art program is rooted in a strong foundation in drawing and visual composition. Students spend the first year drawing the figure, surveying and depicting landscapes, and experimenting with a variety of media such as acrylic, pastel, and oil. In the second and third years, they create a portfolio of work that culminates in a gallery exhibit at Roux North.</p>
<h3>Graphic Design</h3>
<p>Department chair: <strong>Henri Lee</strong><br>
This department specializes in product design, illustration, graphics, and marketing, with emphasis on approach and positioning. In year one and year two, students are equipped with the core ideas and skills necessary for a career in graphic design, and choose an elective module where they can employ, extend, and challenge those ideas and skills. Students study alongside working artists and designers on thesis-based projects.</p>
<h3>Photography</h3>
<p>Department chair: <strong>Max Banks</strong><br>
  The Photography program is designed to teach students basic photographic skills and help them develop a creative style and visual problem-solving skills while engaging in specialized market areas and techniques.</p>

<h1>Alumni Interview</h1>
<dl>
  <dt>Q: What is it that fuels your work?</dt>
  <dd>AP: I wanted to create art that reminded people of what it felt like being alive. Not just the sensual but the visceral. And to be happy about it. I'm not the kind of artist that believes in the merits of suffering.</dd>
  <dt>Q: I noticed you've drank about a gallon of green tea since we've started, is that normal?</dt>
  <dd>AP: I did literally live on this stuff at Roux. Tea fueled all-nighters! Not very debauched, I know, but true.</dd>
  <dt>Q: How did Roux Academy contribute to your growth as an artist?</dt>
  <dd>AP: During my first year, I had been messing around with inks, Sumi inks and blockwash techniques, combined with the tag style I was seeing on the streets. It was very cartoony and figurative. The second year I remember sharing a dorm room with this metal shop dude and he was describing his work to me in these oddball colors. I mean, he was working with steel, but in his mind, it wasn't grey. It was colored by everything around them and he'd get excited by the idea of moving this massive sculpture, we're talking ten feet high, into new spaces, just so he could see how it would take on new colors. And that got me thinking about light and reflectivity in a different way. Over the years, my style has become more and more abstract. Last year, I completed a set of drip paintings [titled Seaward Exit: Brighton Beach] and it really freed me up to do more, I would say, languid work. And I'm getting older. There's only so long that you can do that kind of young, hotheaded stuff.</dd>
  <dt>Q: Any advice for current Roux students?</dt>
  <dd>AP: Don't give up the joy. Once you transition to the real world, the art scene, an office, or something else, there can be a lot of pressure to renounce or forget the wonder that is part of the creative process. Hang on to that. Roux is not a shelter; you can recreate and carry the experience you're having now with you everywhere.</dd>

<h1>Pullout Quote</h1>
<p>
    <blockquote>Roux Academy's Graphic Desgin program helped me mature both as a designer and as a creative professional. Their cross-disciplinary approach helped me see multiple sides and solutions to every problem I encountered, and that's something that has translated to how I approach design in my career. Roux Academy was tremendously important in helping shape the designer I've become.</blockquote>
