        <p> <strong class="headingtext">Scalable Vector Graphics</strong> <span class="ptext">are vector based images that can adjust for different scales. They are helpful for creating content that will display effectively across different screen sizes. If you are trying to keep text looking sharp whether it is on widescreen computer monitor or an old iPhone, SVG can help. On the technical side SVGs work by displaying different images based upon what resolution the viewing screen is. So if the media screen is set at 400 pixels, below 400 pixels one image will display and above 400 pixels a different image will display. In order to make sure multiple images donâ€™t display at the same time you have to name each media screen and then create a rule that blocks the display. It in It is possible to many different media screen sizes to appeal to multiple screen sizes.</span></p>
